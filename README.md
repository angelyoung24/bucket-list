# Bucket List
***

## Description
Bucket List is an app built in ReactJS that allows you to create a list of things that you want to do an check them off. This is version 1 of the app. It is my first app in ReactJS. 

## Roadmap
For future versions:
* The entire photo in the background visable at all times
* Use a design framework like Material-UI or Bootstrap
* Saving the list objects
